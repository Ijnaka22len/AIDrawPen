# AiDrawPen

## Overview

AiDrawPen is an innovative application designed to assist in the rehabilitation of children through a wireless gesture-based drawing pen. This project aims to make rehabilitation exercises more engaging and fun for kids, encouraging them to participate actively in their therapy sessions. The pen allows kids to draw and interact with digital interfaces using gestures, making the rehabilitation process more interactive and enjoyable.

## Features

- **Wireless Gesture-Based Drawing Pen**: Designed for kids to draw and interact using gestures.
- **Engaging and Interactive**: Makes rehabilitation exercises fun and engaging.
- **Progress Tracking**: Monitors and visualizes children's progress over time.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Tailored specifically for children.
- **Tiny ML Model Deployment**: Real-time shape recognition for circles, V-shapes, and triangles using a model deployed on the EFR32MG32 microcontroller.
- **History of Drawing Activities**: Detailed history tracking for monitoring improvements.

## Tiny ML Model

The AiDrawPen project incorporates a tiny Machine Learning (ML) model capable of recognizing basic shapes such as circles, V-shapes, and triangles. This model is deployed on the EFR32MG32 microcontroller, enabling real-time shape recognition. By utilizing this model, the pen can accurately detect and interpret the shapes drawn by children, providing immediate feedback and tracking their progress.
